    <p class="first">You keep crawling, you never were a cat person.</p>
    <p class="second">You look at the kitten, and crawl right past it. "Cats are irritating," you say as you crawl past.
        The kitten looks at you with it's big brown eyes. Except the look it's giving you isn't sad...it's almost
        sinister, like it wants you dead! But you crawl on anyway; you have more important things to do than worry about a
        tiny kitten! You start to crawl again, hand over foot as your head starts to feel a bit funny. "I'm probably
        just tired" you think to yourself. As you're crawling,
        you hear something behind you; you
        look back to see...it's the kitten! It's trotting behind you trying to keep up. You crawl faster, what does this
        cat want anyway? The kitten runs faster to keep its trail only a foot behind your feet. You crawl and crawl for
        what seems like hours. Your pants are covered in grass stains, your hands are rough from friction on the grass,
        you're sweating like crazy. You look back at the kitten, who has kept the same pace this whole time, and it looks
        the exact same. It's not tired in the slightest. "How can this be?" You think. You realize you can
        just stand up and run, except you can't, you physically can't stand up. You realize you can't stop either, your
        body is forcing you to keep crawling at this uncomfortably fast pace. That's when you finally realize. This is hell. You
        went to hell for your hatred of cats and this what you get, getting chased by a strangely fast kitten for all of
        eternity while you crawl away from it. Are you happy now? Happy you didn't pet the kitten?</p>
        <p>Well good job. Now you're dead and stuck here for all eternity...nice.</p>
    <a href="story_start.html">Try again?</a>
