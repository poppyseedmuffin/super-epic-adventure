    <p class="first">You crawl like a tiny baby.</p>
    <p class="second">You crawl on the grass slowly. Listening for any sign of people or animals, but all you hear is
        the wind and the distant sound of cawing crows. You crawl for a long time, daydreaming about how you got here,
        and what you might find; just when you're about to give up and
        take a break, you see something small just within your range of visibility. You crawl a little closer. It's a
        kitten! A tiny cat colored orange with stripes, it sits there staring at you. "What on earth are you doing out
        here?" You say to the little guy. Suprisingly, the kitten doesn't answer, instead it just twitches it's nose and tilt it's head.</p>
        <p>What do you do now?</p>
