    <p class="first">You run like the wind!</p>
    <p class="second">You bolt. You run as fast as you can into the darkness ahead of you. You hear some strange sounds
        as you whip past. You run and run wincing at the thought of smacking into something. Luckily for you this
        doesn't happen! Instead as you're running you fall into a sinkhole. You fall down into a pitch black pit of
        water. You sit there treading cold water while in shock of what just happened. As your treading you look down to see a tiny shiny light.</p>
    <p>Where do you swim?</p>
    <p class="second"><a href="Swim_down.html">Swim down towards the light.</a><strong> or </strong><a href="Swim_foward.html">Swim forward towards the darkness.</a></p>
