    <p class="second">You open your eyes to nothingness. It's dark, extrmely dark. You look down at your feet and see
        grass. There's a slight, cool breeze so you suspect you're outside. You don't remember how you got here. You
        only know two things: you're hungry, and alone. You have a choice to make. Do you crawl slowly on the grass and
        hope to find something? Or do you run like the wind and hopefully make it to a building or a town?</p>
        <p>What do you do?</p>
       <p class="second"><a href="Run.html">Run like the wind!</a><strong> or </strong><a href="Crawl.html">Crawl every so slowly...</a></p>
