<body>
    <p class="first">You pet the kitten, obviously.</p>
    <p class="second">You crawl forward and pat the little kitten's head. It purrs and closes it's eyes. It is an
        adorable sight. You sit here petting the cat for a little while. You start to forget why you were crawling in
        the first place, but it doesn't matter, the crawling brought you to this kitten. The kitten looks up at you with it's big brown eyes and meows. That's when you see, this is all
        that matters. Who knows what would've happened if you crawled past this little angel? So you sit here, content,
        with the kitten until your dying days (which doesn't take very long since you have no food or water).</p>
    <p>You die a happy death.</p>
