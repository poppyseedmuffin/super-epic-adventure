    <p class="first">Shiny!!!</p>
    <p class="second">You see something shiny, you go toward something shiny. You hold your breath and propell yourself
        downward. The farther you go down the colder the water gets. You continue to swim but the shiny thing doesn't
        seem to be getting much closer. You are about to run out of breath when you finally reach the source of light.
        It's fairly large, about the size of a manhole, but you can't tell what it is, it's way too bright. In fact, it
        looks like pure light. You swim even closer until you realize you are no longer in water, and now you're
        free-falling. You're falling towards a white surface! You close your eyes right before you hit it but you don't
        die...they were clouds. You look down and realize you are hurdling toward a field. You look forward to see what
        looks like a giant sinkhole. You don't have much time to wonder what's going on before you...</p>
