    <p class="first">You swim forward.</p>
    <p class="second">You swim forward into the darkness. You can't see a thing, except for the tiny light deep below
        you. You start to become anxious about what could be in this pool of water. You swim a little faster. You swim
        until you hit something cold and slimy. You try to swim backward but you can't, it's blocked off. In fact, you
        can't swim anywhere! You're trapped! You start to slide down this slimy tube until you hit liquid again. "It's
        kind of warm in here" you think as you wonder where on earth you could be. You don't get a lot of time to wonder
        as the stomach acid from the megladon that swallowed you starts to digest you. Ouch...</p>
        <p>What did you expect?</p>
